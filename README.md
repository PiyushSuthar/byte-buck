It simply helps in calculating bytes and humanizing them.

## ⚡ Usage
```sh
yarn add bytes-buck
# OR npm install bytes-buck

### Example:-
```ts
import byteBuck from 'bytes-buck'

let result = byteBuck(
  // Bytes you want to sum
  ["5 GiB", "12 MiB", "5 GB"],

  // Places after decimal, ex. 4.5678 KB
  4,

  // If true, 4...KB will eb converted to 4...KiB
  true
)
```
